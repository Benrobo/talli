# Talli PRD

**Product:** Talli  
**Tagline:** AI treasurer and savings assistant for chats  
**Platforms:** WhatsApp private chat, Telegram private chat, Telegram group chat, web dashboard  
**Payment provider:** Nomba  
**Primary stack:** Hono.js, Drizzle ORM, TanStack Router  
**Document status:** Hackathon PRD draft  
**Last updated:** 2026-06-22

---

## 1. Product Summary

Talli is a conversational money assistant that lets users collect money, track payments, run savings jars, and manage group contributions directly inside chat.

Users configure their workspace from a web dashboard, connect their payment setup, then link the bot to WhatsApp private chat, Telegram private chat, or Telegram group chats.

The bot understands natural language commands like:

```txt
Save ₦2,000 to my rent jar
Collect ₦5,000 from everyone for Friday hangout
Who has not paid?
How much have we collected?
Remind people who have not paid
Show me my receipt for yesterday's payment
```

Talli should not behave like an uncontrolled AI bank agent. AI is used to understand user intent, summarize payment status, and produce helpful replies. All actual payment actions must be deterministic, permission-checked, and confirmed through Nomba payment flows and webhooks.

---

## 2. Problem

A lot of financial coordination already happens inside WhatsApp and Telegram chats, but the actual payment tracking happens manually.

Common problems:

- People collect money for events, food, rent, class dues, church activities, football pitch, wedding committees, and group savings manually.
- Admins have to ask “who has paid?” repeatedly.
- Members send screenshots instead of having verifiable payment status.
- The person collecting money manually reconciles names, amounts, bank alerts, and chat messages.
- Personal saving apps require the user to open a separate app and behave with discipline before spending.
- Payment links are disconnected from the chat where the money conversation started.

The core pain is not just payment. The core pain is **coordination, tracking, confirmation, reminders, and trust**.

---

## 3. Product Vision

Talli should become the money assistant inside everyday chat.

The long-term vision:

> Anywhere money is discussed in chat, Talli can help structure it, collect it, track it, explain it, and remind the right people.

For the hackathon MVP:

> Talli helps users create collections and savings jars from chat, lets people pay through Nomba Checkout or virtual accounts, and updates payment status automatically through Nomba webhooks.

---

## 4. Target Users

### 4.1 Individual Users

People who want to save money, fund personal goals, create quick collections, or track their own payment history through chat.

Examples:

- Young workers saving for rent, phone, laptop, school fees, relocation, or emergency fund.
- People who want to lock money before spending it impulsively.
- People who prefer sending a chat message over opening another finance app.

### 4.2 Group Admins

People responsible for collecting money from others.

Examples:

- Football group admins
- Class reps
- Church/youth group treasurers
- Office lunch organizers
- Roommate group admins
- Wedding committee members
- Event organizers
- Community/cooperative admins

### 4.3 Small Businesses and Communities

Small teams or communities that collect repeat payments from members.

Examples:

- Paid groups
- Coaches
- Tutors
- Market associations
- Informal cooperatives
- Social clubs
- Training cohorts

---

## 5. Platform Strategy

Talli is one product with multiple entry points.

### 5.1 WhatsApp

**Scope for MVP:** Private chat only.

WhatsApp should be used for one-on-one bot conversations where users can:

- Link their account.
- Create personal savings jars.
- Fund savings jars.
- Create payment collections.
- Ask payment/status questions.
- Receive receipts and reminders.

WhatsApp group support should be treated as future/experimental because WhatsApp Business Cloud API is primarily designed around business messaging and webhooks, while Telegram has first-class bot behavior for private and group chats.

### 5.2 Telegram

**Scope for MVP:** Private chat and group chat.

Telegram should be the primary demo platform because it supports bot commands, private chats, group chats, inline buttons, and webhooks more naturally.

Telegram supports bot interactions in private chats, groups, and channels depending on bot configuration. Telegram bots also support user inputs like text, media, voice messages, and interactive buttons.

### 5.3 Web App

The web app is the setup and control center.

Users should use the web dashboard to:

- Create workspace.
- Configure bot behavior.
- Link WhatsApp or Telegram chats.
- Manage collections.
- Manage savings jars.
- View payments and receipts.
- View webhook events.
- Manage permissions.
- Request payouts or exports where supported.

---

## 6. Core Product Modes

Talli has two major modes.

---

# 6.1 Collect Mode

Collect Mode helps users collect money from one person, multiple people, or a group.

## Use Cases

- “Collect ₦3,000 from everyone for football pitch.”
- “Create a ₦10,000 payment link for Tunde’s birthday.”
- “Collect ₦50,000 total for office lunch.”
- “Start monthly dues of ₦5,000 for this group.”
- “Who hasn’t paid?”
- “Remind unpaid members.”

## Main Flow: Telegram Group Collection

1. Admin adds Talli to a Telegram group.
2. Admin verifies the group with a code from the web dashboard.
3. Admin sends:

```txt
@Talli collect ₦3,000 from everyone for Saturday football pitch by Friday
```

4. Bot parses the command and asks for confirmation:

```txt
Create collection?

Purpose: Saturday football pitch
Amount: ₦3,000 per person
Deadline: Friday
Scope: Everyone in this group

[Create Collection] [Cancel]
```

5. Admin confirms.
6. Bot posts payment CTA:

```txt
Saturday football pitch collection is live.

Amount: ₦3,000 per person
Paid: 0/12
Total collected: ₦0

[Pay ₦3,000]
```

7. Member clicks payment button.
8. Web payment page opens.
9. App creates Nomba Checkout order or virtual account payment flow.
10. Member pays.
11. Nomba sends webhook.
12. App verifies and processes webhook.
13. Bot updates group:

```txt
✅ Benaiah paid ₦3,000
Progress: ₦3,000 / ₦36,000
Paid: 1/12
```

14. Members/admins can ask:

```txt
Who has not paid?
How much remains?
Did Opeyemi pay?
Remind defaulters
```

---

# 6.2 Save Mode

Save Mode helps users create and fund savings jars through chat.

## Use Cases

- “Save ₦2,000 to my Rent Jar.”
- “Create a jar for laptop, target ₦500,000.”
- “Save ₦1,000 every Friday.”
- “Lock ₦10,000 until next month.”
- “How much have I saved this month?”
- “Start a 30-day ₦1,000 daily challenge.”

## Main Flow: Private Savings Jar

1. User links WhatsApp or Telegram private chat.
2. User sends:

```txt
Save ₦2,000 to my rent jar
```

3. Bot replies:

```txt
I’ll help you fund your Rent Jar with ₦2,000.

Current progress: ₦42,000 / ₦200,000

[Pay ₦2,000] [Cancel]
```

4. User clicks payment button.
5. Nomba Checkout opens.
6. User pays.
7. Nomba webhook confirms payment.
8. Bot replies:

```txt
✅ ₦2,000 saved to Rent Jar.

New progress: ₦44,000 / ₦200,000
```

---

## 7. Product Differentiation

Talli should not be positioned as a PiggyVest clone or a normal contribution app.

The key difference:

> Talli brings payment coordination and savings actions into the chat where people already talk about money.

Unique angles:

1. **Chat-native finance**  
   Users create and manage money flows through natural language.

2. **Group money intelligence**  
   The bot can answer “who paid?”, “who hasn’t paid?”, and “how much remains?” instantly.

3. **Webhook-native tracking**  
   Payment status comes from Nomba webhooks, not screenshots or manual confirmation.

4. **Private and group use**  
   Same product works for personal savings and group collections.

5. **AI as treasurer interface, not payment authority**  
   AI understands commands, but business rules control payments.

6. **Verification and permissions**  
   Chats must be linked securely before the bot can act for a workspace.

---

## 8. High-Level Requirements

## 8.1 Web Dashboard

### Required Features

- User authentication.
- Workspace creation.
- Platform selection: WhatsApp private, Telegram private, Telegram group.
- Generate chat verification code.
- Show linked chats.
- Manage bot settings.
- Manage collections.
- Manage savings jars.

---

## 8.2 Chat Verification

Chat verification is required so the bot knows which workspace owns a private chat or group chat.

### Private Chat Linking

1. User opens web dashboard.
2. User selects platform.
3. System generates a private link code:

```txt
/start KOL-9281
```

4. User sends the code to the bot in private chat.
5. System links platform user ID or phone number to the app user.

### Telegram Group Linking

1. Workspace owner creates a group link code:

```txt
KOL-8F29
```

2. Owner adds Talli to Telegram group.
3. Owner sends:

```txt
@Talli verify KOL-8F29
```

4. Bot validates code.
5. Bot links Telegram `chat_id` to workspace.
6. Bot stores the verifier as group owner/admin.
7. Bot confirms:

```txt
This group is now linked to Benaiah Football Club.
Only approved admins can create collections or request payouts.
```

### Verification Rules

- Verification codes should expire after a short period, for example 15 minutes.
- Codes should be one-time use.
- Codes should be scoped to a workspace and platform.
- Group verification should store platform chat ID and verifier ID.
- Bot should refuse financial commands in unverified chats.

---

## 8.3 Bot Command Understanding

The bot should understand natural language commands and map them to structured intents.

### Example Input

```txt
@Talli abeg collect 2k from everybody for Tunde birthday before Saturday
```

### Parsed Output

```json
{
  "intent": "create_collection",
  "amount": 2000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "scope": "all_group_members",
  "purpose": "Tunde birthday",
  "deadline": "Saturday",
  "requires_confirmation": true
}
```

### Supported MVP Intents

- `verify_chat`
- `create_collection`
- `confirm_collection`
- `cancel_collection`
- `collection_status`
- `list_unpaid_members`
- `remind_unpaid_members`
- `create_savings_jar`
- `fund_savings_jar`
- `savings_status`
- `show_receipt`
- `help`

### AI Rules

- AI should only parse and summarize.
- AI must not call Nomba APIs directly.
- AI must not move money.
- AI must not override role permissions.
- Low-confidence commands should trigger clarification.
- Financial actions require confirmation.

---

## 8.4 Payment Flow

### Payment Options

MVP should support Nomba Checkout first.

Nomba Checkout provides a hosted payment page and supports multiple payment methods depending on availability, including card, bank transfer, USSD, QR, and other methods.

Virtual accounts can be added for more bank-transfer-native flows. Nomba virtual accounts can receive bank transfers and can be used for customer-specific or purpose-specific payment receiving.

### Payment Creation Flow

1. User clicks payment CTA from chat.
2. App opens web payment page.
3. App creates Nomba Checkout order.
4. App stores Nomba order reference.
5. User completes payment.
6. Nomba sends webhook.
7. App verifies webhook.
8. App updates ledger/payment status.
9. Bot sends confirmation message.

### Webhook Rules

- Store webhook event before processing.
- Verify webhook signature/header when available.
- Use event ID or transaction reference for idempotency.
- Do not double-credit payments.
- Do not trust frontend success redirect as final payment confirmation.
- Keep raw payload for audit/debugging.

---

## 8.5 Collections

### Collection Types

MVP collection types:

1. **Fixed-per-person collection**  
   Example: ₦3,000 from everyone.

2. **Open contribution collection**  
   Example: Collect any amount toward ₦100,000.

3. **Named-member collection**  
   Example: Collect ₦5,000 from Tolu, Ope, Daniel, and Mary.

Post-MVP collection types:

- Recurring dues.
- Tiered contribution amounts.
- Installment collection.
- Conditional group target.
- Group savings challenge.

### Collection Statuses

- `draft`
- `active`
- `paid`
- `partially_paid`
- `expired`
- `cancelled`
- `closed`

### Collection Member Payment Statuses

- `not_paid`
- `pending`
- `paid`
- `underpaid`
- `overpaid`
- `refunded`
- `manual_review`

---

## 8.6 Savings Jars

### Savings Jar Fields

- Name
- Target amount
- Current amount
- Lock date
- Description
- Owner
- Status

### Savings Jar Statuses

- `active`
- `locked`
- `completed`
- `cancelled`
- `withdrawn`

### MVP Savings Commands

```txt
Create a jar for rent, target ₦200,000
Save ₦2,000 to rent jar
How much is in my rent jar?
Lock ₦10,000 until July 30
```

### Recurring Savings

Recurring savings can be treated as post-MVP if direct debit or recurring card tokenization is not stable in the hackathon sandbox.

MVP can simulate recurring reminders:

```txt
Remind me every Friday to save ₦1,000
```

The bot sends a payment link on schedule instead of automatically debiting the user.

---

## 15. Payment Safety and Compliance Principles

1. AI must not move money directly.
2. Every payment creation must pass deterministic validation.
3. Every financial action must be role-checked.
4. Every payment must require user confirmation.
5. Payment success must be confirmed through Nomba webhook or verification endpoint.
6. Webhooks must be idempotent.
7. Sensitive actions must be logged.
8. Payouts/transfers should be owner-only and can be post-MVP.
9. Savings should be represented as internal ledger balances unless a compliant wallet/savings structure is provided.
10. Avoid promising interest, investment returns, or banking features in MVP.

---

## 16. Webhook Processing Design

Webhook endpoint:

```txt
POST /api/nomba/webhook
```

Processing steps:

1. Receive webhook.
2. Store raw payload in `webhook_events`.
3. Verify provider signature/header.
4. Check if event was already processed.
5. Identify related payment by provider reference/order ID.
6. Update payment status.
7. Update collection member status or savings jar balance.
8. Create audit log.
9. Send bot notification.
10. Mark webhook as processed.

Failure behavior:

- If signature invalid, mark as failed/ignored.
- If payment cannot be matched, mark as manual review.
- If bot notification fails, payment should remain successful; notification can be retried.
- If duplicate webhook arrives, ignore safely.

---

## 17. Bot Reply Style

The bot should be friendly, direct, and low-noise.

Good style:

```txt
✅ Payment confirmed.
Benaiah paid ₦3,000 for Saturday football.

Progress: ₦12,000 / ₦36,000
Paid: 4/12
```

Avoid:

```txt
Wow amazing! Your spectacular financial transaction has been successfully processed!
```

The bot should feel like a responsible treasurer, not a noisy mascot.

---

---

## 20. Risks and Mitigations

## Risk: WhatsApp group support may be limited

Mitigation:

- MVP supports WhatsApp private chat only.
- Telegram supports both private and group use.
- Present WhatsApp group support as future/provider-dependent.

## Risk: AI misinterprets command

Mitigation:

- Always show confirmation before action.
- Use structured JSON intent parsing.
- Ask clarification when confidence is low.

## Risk: Duplicate webhook credits payment twice

Mitigation:

- Store provider event ID/reference.
- Use database uniqueness constraints.
- Make processing idempotent.

## Risk: Product sounds like a bank/savings institution

Mitigation:

- Position MVP as payment collection and savings ledger assistant.
- Avoid interest/investment claims.
- Use Nomba for payment collection.

## Risk: Users try unauthorized payout commands

Mitigation:

- Owner-only payout permissions.
- Confirmation and audit logs.
- Payout can be excluded from MVP.

## 22. Sources and Platform Notes

- Telegram Bot API is an HTTP-based interface for building Telegram bots. Telegram bots can receive private chat messages and, depending on bot privacy/settings, can work in groups.
- Telegram bots support user inputs such as text, files, locations, stickers, and voice messages, plus interactive UI tools like buttons.
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API supports business messaging and webhook events, but this PRD scopes WhatsApp to private chat for MVP to avoid group-bot complexity.
- Nomba Checkout is a hosted payment page for accepting payments through supported methods.
- Nomba virtual accounts can be created to receive bank transfers.
- Nomba webhooks notify the app when payment events occur and should be verified and processed idempotently.

## 23. Final Product Positioning

Talli is not just a savings app or contribution tracker.

It is:

> **An AI treasurer and savings assistant for the chats where money conversations already happen.**

MVP promise:

> Set it up on the web, link it to WhatsApp private chat or Telegram private/group chat, then collect money, fund savings jars, track who paid, and answer money questions naturally.
